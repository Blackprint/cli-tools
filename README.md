# Blackprint CLI
This CLI contains tools for compiling/building nodes for Blackprint.

You can install this globally
```sh
$ npm i -g @blackprint/cli-tools
```

## Create a new module from template
```sh
$ blackprint create
```

## Module server for development
The `build` and `serve` command will watch for `blackprint.config.js` from current working directory and search deeper inside of `nodes` directory. So.. make sure you're not putting `node_modules` inside of `nodes` directory, or it will fill up your computer memory ðŸ˜…

To use it, you can execute this command on the root of your project.
```sh
$ blackprint serve
```

## Build command
To build the module, you need execute this command on the root of your project.
```sh
$ blackprint build
```

To minify the files for production, you can use `production` or `prod`.
```sh
$ blackprint build prod
```

If you installed this with `package.json` on your project, you can use npx.
```sh
$ npx blackprint build
```
